#Next we will look at one of the most common statements you can use,
#the print() statement.

#look at each of these statements, and guess what the output will 
#be:

a = "Hello World" #this creates a variable called 'a' and assigns it the value of the text "Hello World"
print a 

#The print statement/function is used to send information to the terminal. The terminal is a fancy 
#way of describing the computer's screen. What do you think the output on the terminal's screen will be?
#what about this???

print "Hello World"

#do you think that there will be any difference between this output, and the first print statement?
#let's try a third way.......

print("Hello World")

#Take a guess as to what this third print statement does?
#One more, and this one may be a bit confusing.....

foo = 100
print"If you guessed this correctly, your grade is %s", foo

#That one was pretty neat, right?

"""Some questions to think about:
1)Based on the file above, what is a variable?
2)Is the '=' used here in the same way that you would use it in math class?
3)For that last example, why do you think it might be useful?
